# panoramic-venture
 
To run the main program, simply run the Panorama.py file. The file uses the RAN.py module and it is already imported, also all the necessary images are self clicked with a ratio of 1:1 by a hand held device with sufficient overlap. These images are stored in the respective folders numbered left to right. Also, after running the program, the image will be saved in the directory with the folder's name.
